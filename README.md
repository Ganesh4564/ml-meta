# Annotated Algorithms & Machine Learning Textbook

This project is a web-based, interactive textbook that presents core concepts from computer science and machine learning. It features a unique side-by-side layout that displays original textbook passages alongside detailed, easy-to-understand explanations and annotations.

The platform is designed for a clean reading experience, with beautiful rendering of mathematical formulas and pseudocode, making it an ideal resource for students and self-learners.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Side-by-Side Explanations**: Presents original text in a distinct block next to a corresponding plain-language explanation, making complex topics easier to digest.
* **Dynamic Table of Contents**: Each chapter page automatically generates a table of contents in the sidebar based on its sections, allowing for quick navigation.
* **Professional Math & Code Rendering**: Utilizes **MathJax** for beautiful LaTeX mathematical notation and **pseudocode.js** for cleanly formatted algorithm blocks.
* **Interactive Navigation**: The main page features collapsible sections for different books, and the chapter view provides persistent navigation.
* **Integrated Comments**: Each chapter includes a comment section powered by **Utterances**, allowing readers to ask questions and discuss the material using their GitHub accounts.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and optimized for reading on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run a local copy of this project, you can use any simple local web server. No complex build steps are required.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/COD1995/ml-meta.git](https://github.com/COD1995/ml-meta.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd ml-meta
    ```

3.  **Start a local web server.**
    If you have Python 3 installed, you can use its built-in server:
    ```sh
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code.

4.  **Open the project in your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the address provided by your server) to view the `index.html` home page.

## How It Works

The project's interactivity is powered by a small set of client-side JavaScript files.

* `assets/js/main.js`: This script runs on every chapter page. It scans the main content for `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags, automatically generates anchor IDs for them, and populates the Table of Contents (`#toc-list`) in the sidebar with corresponding links.
* **Inline Scripts**: The HTML files contain small scripts to initialize and render **MathJax** and **pseudocode.js**, ensuring that mathematical formulas and algorithms are displayed correctly after the page content is loaded.
