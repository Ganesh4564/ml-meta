                  this helps with shortest paths, suppose we want to figure out
                  distances from node $S$ to the other nodes. For concreteness,
                  let's focus on node $D$. The only way to get to it is through
                  its predecessors, $B$ or $C$; so to find the shortest path to
                  $D$, we need only compare these two routes:</em

                The key feature of a DAG that makes it easy to work with is that
                it has no cycles. This means its vertices can be
                <strong>linearized</strong> (also known as being topologically
                sorted)—arranged in a straight line such that all directed edges
                only point from left to right. This ordering is fundamental
                because it guarantees that by the time you process any node, you
                have <em>already</em> processed all the nodes that could
                possibly lead to it.

                This section provides the core mathematical relationship, or

                shortest path to any node <code>D</code> must pass through one
                of its immediate predecessors (<code>B</code> or
                <code>C</code> in the example). Therefore, we only need to
                compare the path lengths of those incoming routes:

                <li>

                important to distinguish between a "substring" (which must be

                This is a crucial step in finding a solution: transforming the
                problem into a different domain. Here, the sequence problem is
                converted into a graph problem. Each number in the sequence
                becomes a node in a graph. A directed edge is drawn from node

                subsequence (meaning `j` appears after `i` in the sequence and

                This paragraph reveals the solution path. The graph we
                constructed is a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** because edges
                only point from smaller indices to larger ones, so it's
                impossible to form a cycle. Crucially, any path through this DAG
                corresponds exactly to a valid increasing subsequence.
                Therefore, the LIS problem has now been simplified to finding
                the **longest path in a DAG**—a well-understood graph problem.

                <li>
                  To calculate $L(j)$, we look at all previous nodes $i$ that
                  could connect to $j$ (i.e., where $i < j$ and $a_i < a_j$). We
                  find the one that has the longest path ending at it (the

                  <strong>An ordering:</strong> We solve the subproblems in a

                The runtime of this algorithm is analyzed. For each element $j$,
                we look at all previous elements $i < j$. In the worst case (a
                sorted array), every previous element is a valid predecessor.
                This results in a nested loop structure, giving a total runtime
                of $O(n^2)$. To reconstruct the actual subsequence (not just its
                length), we can use a `prev` array, just as in Dijkstra's
                algorithm. When we find the best predecessor `i` for `j`, we
                store it: `prev[j] = i`. After the `L` array is full, we can
                find the max value, start from that index, and follow the `prev`
                pointers backward to find the path.
